*Using 'checkout' will automatically switch you onto this branch*

**After making your changes:**

git add .

git commit ------>> press 'i' key to edit then: <topic>:<message>, hit esc, then type :wq and hit enter

git push -u origin <your new branch name>

1\. Analyse website with Google lighthouse to identify areas of improvement

2\. Identify other front end testing tools that could be used in addition to Lighthouse

2\. Compile Report outlining findings and action points derived from this

This will achieve the following deliverables:

Cleaner platform, minimising errors (technical and cosmetic), improving overall look and feel of website increasing companies brand.

**DDGIT Website**

Our first task, we will need to locate or document website site map, create an excel file that we can use to document our findings for each page. We will need comparisons for how it is is displaying in different web browsers and devices. We can collaborate on this excel file in Teams but less work if we can add it to GitHub and then our contributions will be tracked as was mentioned in class today.
