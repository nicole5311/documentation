# Cybersecurity Planning Report for the OnTrack Data Analytics Platform

### Executive Summary

- The increasing importance of data analytics in academia and the potential vulnerabilities that may
  arise warrant the development of a robust cybersecurity plan for the OnTrack Data Analytics
  Platform (DAP). This report outlines the key strategies and considerations in establishing such a
  plan, with a focus on ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability while maintaining
  user trust and regulatory compliance.

### I. Risk Assessment

- A comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted to identify potential threats and
  vulnerabilities. This includes evaluating risks related to data breaches, unauthorized access,
  data loss, and system downtime. The identified risks will be ranked based on their potential
  impact and likelihood of occurrence to prioritize mitigation strategies.

### II. Network Security

- We will deploy advanced network security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection
  systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to monitor and safeguard against
  unauthorized access or potential attacks. Network access will be controlled through VPNs for
  remote access, and network traffic will be encrypted using secure protocols like TLS and HTTPS.

### III. Access Control

- The OnTrack DAP will employ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) which ensures that users can only
  access data and functionalities pertinent to their role, preventing unauthorized access and
  potential data breaches. Two-factor authentication (2FA) will be implemented for an extra layer of
  security during user authentication.

### IV. Data Security

- Data will be encrypted both at rest and in transit. Backups will be regularly performed and stored
  offsite to prevent data loss in the event of a system failure or cyber attack. Anonymization and
  pseudonymization techniques will be applied to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### V. Security Awareness and Training

- Employees will undergo regular cybersecurity awareness training. This includes best practices for
  identifying and reporting potential security threats, secure data handling, and understanding the
  importance of adhering to cybersecurity policies and procedures.

### VI. Incident Response Plan

- A detailed incident response plan will be developed to ensure a rapid, effective, and orderly
  response to any cybersecurity incidents. This includes defining roles and responsibilities,
  developing communication strategies, and establishing procedures for containing the incident,
  eradicating the threat, and recovering from the attack.

### VII. Regular Audits and Compliance

- Regular security audits will be conducted to identify any potential vulnerabilities and to verify
  that all security measures are functioning as intended. The platform will comply with all relevant
  regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we will engage with
  external cybersecurity consultants as needed to ensure regulatory compliance.

### VIII. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

- Given the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous monitoring of the OnTrack DAP
  system and regular updates to its security features are critical. We will keep abreast of the
  latest cybersecurity developments, threats, and mitigation strategies and adapt our cybersecurity
  plan accordingly.

### Conclusion

- In developing the OnTrack DAP, our priority is to ensure the security and privacy of all user
  data. This cybersecurity planning report forms the basis of our strategy to safeguard the platform
  from potential threats. Through continuous monitoring and improvement, regular training,
  comprehensive incident response plans, and stringent adherence to regulatory guidelines, we are
  committed to providing a secure, reliable, and trustworthy data analytics platform for Deakin
  University.
