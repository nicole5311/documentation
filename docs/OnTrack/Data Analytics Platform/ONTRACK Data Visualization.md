# ONTRACK Data Visualization
### This document presents an overview, pros and cons, scope, data collection method, sample data, and details for three graphs: "Subject Accesses (Weekly Analysis)", "Scatter Plot for Time Spent in Subjects", and "Average Student Opting for D (Grade vs. Time before Deadline)".

## 1.Subject Accesses (Weekly Analysis) Graph
## Overview
* The Subject Accesses (Weekly Analysis) Graph is a bar chart representation of the frequency of subject accesses by different students. The graph includes three subjects (Subject 1, Subject 2, and Subject 3) across four different students (Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 4).

## Pros
* Intuitive Visualization: A bar chart is an easy-to-understand representation that allows comparison between students' frequency of accessing different subjects.

* Comparative Analysis: The graph enables a comparative view across all students, allowing stakeholders to understand and compare the engagement level of different students for the three subjects.

* Accessible Insights: The graph provides immediate insights into which subjects are accessed most frequently by which students.

* Tracking Progress: It allows teachers and administrators to track the progress of students over time in terms of subject engagement.

## Cons
* Lack of Detail: This graph does not provide insights into what times of day or days of the week the subjects are accessed.

* Limited Context: Without additional information, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the reasons for the differences in the number of accesses.

* Absence of Overall Trends: The graph does not indicate whether there are trends in the total number of accesses over time.

* No Individual Performance Indication: The frequency of subject access does not necessarily correlate with understanding or performance in the subject.

## Scope
* This graph is primarily suited for monitoring student engagement with different subjects on a weekly basis. It can be used by teachers, tutors, and educational administrators to understand student behavior, plan interventions, and set benchmarks for subject engagement.

## Data Collection
* Data for this graph can be collected via educational management systems or learning management systems which record the number of times a student accesses a subject in a week. Each subject access by a student is logged and then compiled into weekly data.

## Sample Data
Student  | Subject 1|Subject 2|Subject 3
------------- | -------------| -------------| -------------
Student1 | 2| 3| 2
Student2  | 2| 5| 1
Student3  | 1| 2| 0
Student4  | 3| 2.8|5

## Graph Details
* In this graph, the x-axis represents the different students, while the y-axis represents the number of times a subject has been accessed in a week (ranging from 0 to 6). Each student has three bars, representing the three different subjects. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of times a subject was accessed by the respective student in a week.


## 2. Scatter Plot for Time Spent in Subjects
## Overview
* The "Scatter Plot for Time Spent in Subjects" is a graph representing the amount of time (in minutes) spent on subjects throughout the week. It is a scatter plot with the X-axis representing the days of the week (from Monday to Sunday) and the Y-axis representing time spent in minutes (ranging from 0 to 90).

## Pros
* Time Trend Analysis: This graph provides a clear visualization of the time spent on subjects throughout the week, which can help in identifying trends and patterns.
* Visual Clarity: The scatter plot is a simple and intuitive form of data representation which makes it easy to visualize and understand the data points.
* Versatility: Scatter plots are ideal for visualizing and understanding the relationship between two numerical variables.

## Cons
* Limited Information: The scatter plot does not provide information about which subjects were studied on which days or at what times. It only provides overall time spent on subjects.

* Absence of Correlation Information: It does not show correlation between the time spent studying and academic performance or progress.

* Lack of Detail: Data points are scattered, making it difficult to determine exact values for each day without proper annotations.

## Scope
* The graph is useful for students, teachers, and parents to monitor and manage time spent on subjects over a week. It can be a valuable tool for time management and planning study schedules.

## Data Collection
* Data for this graph can be collected using time-tracking tools, digital calendars, or learning management systems that track the duration of study sessions. It involves logging the start and end times of each study session for each day, then calculating the total time spent on subjects each day.

## Sample Data
Day | 	Time Spent (in mins) 
------------- | -------------
Monday | 30
Tuesday  | 45
Wednesday  | 35
Thursday  | 60
Friday  | 80
Saturday  | 35
Sunday  | 0

## Graph Details
* The scatter plot presents data points for each day of the week with the corresponding time spent studying subjects. The trend line (dotted) shows the pattern of time spent studying from high to low from Monday to Friday. 


## 3. Average Student Opting for D (Grade vs. Time before Deadline) Chart
## Overview
* The "Average Student Opting for D (Grade vs. Time before Deadline)" Chart is a scatter plot representing the relation between the time taken before the deadline to submit work and the grade achieved. The X-axis represents the time before the deadline taken by an average student opting for grade 'D' to submit, ranging from 0 to 6. The Y-axis represents the time before the deadline taken by an average distinction student to submit, ranging from 0 to 4.5.

## Pros
* Performance Indicator: This chart provides a visual comparison of the submission habits of average students vs. distinction students, offering potential insights into performance indicators.
* Early Detection of Struggles: By identifying the time taken to submit work, teachers or tutors can identify students who might be struggling and offer support sooner.
* Influence on Study Habits: This visual representation might help students understand the potential impact of their time management on their grades.

## Cons
* Limited Scope: The chart only compares two groups of students, those opting for 'D' and distinction students. It does not provide insights into other grade levels or factors influencing performance.
* No Causality: While the graph might show a correlation between time taken to submit and grades, it does not prove that earlier submission causes higher grades.
* Assumed Consistency: The chart assumes that all assignments across all subjects have similar levels of complexity and require the same amount of time to complete, which may not be accurate.

## Scope
* This chart can be used by teachers and educational administrators to understand the relationship between submission time and grade outcomes. It might also be useful for students to self-assess their time management skills in relation to their academic performance.

## Data Collection
* Data for this graph can be collected through school or university assignment submission systems. These systems usually track the time of submission for each assignment, which can be compared against the deadline. The grade achieved by each student can be extracted from the academic records.

## Sample Data
Time before Deadline by Student opting for 'D'| Time before Deadline by Distinction Student
------------- | -------------
1 | 2
2  | 1
3  | 3
4  | 4
5  | 0


## Graph Details
* The scatter plot displays data points representing the average time before the deadline that work is submitted by students opting for 'D' and distinction students.

## 4. Ellucian Analytics: Trending Performance Rates by Total Funnel Headcount
## Overview
* The following graph depicts the trending performance rates over time. It showcases different metrics like Yield Rate, Confirm Rate, Admit Rate, Applicant Rate, and Inquiry Rate from Fall 2013 to Fall 2015.

##Graph Description

* Yield Rate: The percentage of students who choose to enroll in a particular class or school after being offered admission. Over the years, this rate showed a significant decrease from 54.26% in Fall 2013 to 0% in Fall 2015.

* Confirm Rate: The percentage of students who confirm their admission. This rate also saw a decrease from 53.96% in Fall 2013 to 8% in Fall 2015.

* Admit Rate: The percentage of applicants who are offered admission. Interestingly, this rate increased from 18.49% in Fall 2013 to 32.23% in Fall 2015.

* Inquiry Rate: The percentage of prospective students who showed interest by making an inquiry. This rate was quite stable, around 100% across all three academic years.

##Pros
* Clearly displays multiple metrics over time, enabling easy comparison.
* Trends are easily visible.
* Useful for observing and analyzing changes in student behavior over time.

##Cons
* The graph might be a bit complex and hard to interpret for someone not familiar with the terms.
* It's difficult to visualize the exact percentage for each year due to overlapping lines.
* The graph does not show the cause of the changes, only the trends.

## Scope
* The graph can help educational institutions to understand their admission trends over the years. It can guide decision-making related to marketing, student engagement, and admission processes.

## Data Collection
* The data can be collected through the institution's database, which should track inquiries, applications, admissions, and enrollments for each academic year.


## 5. Grade Distribution
* The following histogram represents the distribution of student grades. It showcases the percentage of students achieving different grades based on their exam scores.

## Graph Description
* The X-axis represents the exam score categories ('F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'). The Y-axis represents the number of students.

### The distribution of grades is as follows:

* F: 10% of students achieved this grade.
* D: 15% of students achieved this grade.
* C: 50% of students achieved this grade, making it the most common grade.
* B: 15% of students achieved this grade.
* A: 10% of students achieved this grade, making it as uncommon as an 'F'.

## Pros
* Clearly displays the distribution of grades, enabling easy understanding of the grade distribution.
* Useful for understanding the overall performance of students in the exam.

## Cons
* Doesn't show the actual scores, only categories.
* Doesn't provide any insights on why certain grades are more common than others.

## Scope
* This graph can help educators understand the overall performance of their students in exams. It can also help identify whether the exams are too hard or too easy based on the grade distribution.

## Data Collection
* The data can be collected from exam results. The scores can then be categorized into the different grade categories based on the chosen grading system.

### Here is the Python code for creating such a plot:
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

> grades = ['F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']
> students = [10, 15, 50, 15, 10]

> plt.bar(grades, students)
> plt.xlabel('Exam Score')
> plt.ylabel('# of Students')
> plt.title('Grade Distribution')
> plt.show()

* This will create a bar chart with the exam scores on the x-axis and the number of students on the y-axis. The number of students is represented as a percentage in your description, but for a histogram, it's usually represented as a count. Adjustments may need to be made based on the actual data working with.
