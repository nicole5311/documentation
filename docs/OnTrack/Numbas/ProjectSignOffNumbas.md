# Project Name: \<\<Project Numbas Integration\>\>

## Delivery Lead: \<\<Delivery Daniel Maddern\>\>

## Student Name:\<\<Student Daniel Maddern\>\>

## Clients: \<\< Julien, Andrew, Jake \>\>

## **Scope**

The purpose of this project is to look at how we can integrate Numbas testing into Ontrack. With the
aim for a test to be presented to the student on submission of a task, prior to submitting
reflections or other required documents. The aim is to be able to let the Unit Chair import, setup
and assign tests to the tasks. Also for students to be able to complete tests as part of the
submission process.

## **Outcomes**

This project will be deliverying a project scope for the clients to sign off on.

A feasiblity study of the ways this can be implemetned.

Rough hand drawn design documents for how this intergration will work.

A data flow diagram of how different data will be accesssed and encapsualted.

Backend coding changes to accomodate and store the tests.

Front end code to support the changes from the Unit chair and student view.

## **Delivery**

There will need to be a means to upload the test files that are created locally via Numbas. An
Addtional window after "requesting feedback" on a task that will present the test, this will then
either take you to the next stage if you pass or go back to the task screen if you do not pass.

There will need to be a configuration section within the Unit chair task setup page.

We will provide different options for the test setup such as: 1: Restricted test attempts 2:
Incremental delays in test attempts 3: Unlimited retrys on a test attempt.

We will also need to either enable or disable a test.

**Student View**

**Data Flow Design** ![DataFlow](documentation\docs\OnTrack\Numbas\DataFlow.jpg "Data Flow Design")

In terms of the changes we will require, we will need a new table in the DB to store the tests.

We will need to create a new API and model to transfer the test data between the front and the back
end.

We will need to create a new service and model in Angular to accomodate this, we will also need to
adjust the existing services such as Unit/Tasks to include the test objects for a student user.

Then we will need to create a new componente for taking the test, as well as adjust the Unit Chair
Task Setup component to include the new settings as per the design above.
